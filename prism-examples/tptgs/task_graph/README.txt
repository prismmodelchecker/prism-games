This case study concerns the problem of scheduling tasks between several processors.

These are turn-based probabilistic timed game (TPTG) models, which are an extension of
stochastic multi-player games with real-valued clocks or, equivalently, a game-based
extension of probabilistic timed automaton (PTA).

This case study [KNP19] extends the the PTA version from [NPS13].
These are extensions of the timed automaton example from [BFLM11].
